					Our vast range of handcrafted wooden block prints makes our collection irresistible, so much that you'd want to make it yours. <br/>
					Woodblock printing on textiles is the process of printing patterns on textiles, usually of linen, cotton or silk, by means of incised wooden blocks. It is the earliest, simplest and slowest of all methods of textile printing.
					Block printing by hand is a slow process. It is, however, capable of yielding highly artistic results, some of which are unobtainable by any other method, and that shows in the quality of our product.
					Ours is a complete package of efficient, creativity and humbleness. <br/>
					Pick Kar before someone else picks!</p>
